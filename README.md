# localStorage-class

The Web Storage API is a set of mechanisms that enable browsers to store key-value pairs. It is designed to be much more intuitive than using cookies.

The key-value pairs represent storage objects, which are similar to objects except they remain intact during page loads, and are always strings. You can access these values like an object or using the getItem() method (more on that later).

localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed.
